# Multi-Label Classification of Rice Quality

This project implements a multi-label classification system for rice quality using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning with the VGG16 model. The dataset consists of images of rice, classified into three categories: `Premium`, `Medium`, and `Not Fit`.
